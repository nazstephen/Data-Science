    "- The PS2 stands out for its remarkable longevity, achieving strong early sales and maintaining high performance long after newer consoles were introduced. This endurance is likely due to its extensive game library, strong developer support, and accessible price point as the console aged.\n",
    "- The Wii made an explosive entry into the market, achieving nearly $150 million in sales in its release year. The console’s innovative motion-sensing technology captured a diverse audience, making it a unique success among non-traditional gamers.\n",
