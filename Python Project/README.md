# Python Project
In this project, you will work with data from the entertainment industry. You will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the “Golden Age” of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing.

The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the “Golden Age” of television also have the most votes.

This project is similar to the tasks you will be getting in your job as a data professional. Many business decisions are initially born as assumptions, your contribution as an expert in the data domain is to answer the question “Did the assumption formulated before the study appear to be true?”

## Description of the data
The data is stored in the file: `/datasets/movies_and_shows.csv`

## Description of columns:

- **name** - first and last name of actor (director)
- **character** - character played (for actors)
- **role** — the person’s contribution to the title (it can be in the capacity either of actor or director)
- **title** — title of movie (show)
- **type** — show or movie
- **genres** — list of genres under which the movie (show) falls
- **release_year** — year when the movie (show) was released
- **imdb_score** — score on IMDb
- **imdb_votes** — votes on IMDb

## Stages 
Data on movies and shows is stored in the `/datasets/movies_and_shows.csv` file. There is no information about the quality of the data, so you will need to explore it before doing the analysis.

First, you'll evaluate the quality of the data and see whether its issues are significant. Then, during data preprocessing, you will try to account for the most critical problems.
 
Your project will consist of three stages:
 1. Data overview
 2. Data preprocessing
 3. Data analysis
