# Projects
Compilation of all projects I've completed throughout [TripleTen's Data Science Bootcamp](https://tripleten.com/data-science/) 

| Project Name              | Description                 | Libraries                      |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------- |:---------------------------|
| Basic Python Project |In this project, you will work with data from the entertainment industry. You will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing. The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. | _pandas_ |
| EDA Project | We will determine whether a game can be said to be successful or not in certain regions or markets and determine which games have the most potential in sales | _pandas and matplotlib_ |
| SDA Project | You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. | _pandas, numpy, scipy and matplotlib_ |
| [Software Development Tools Project](https://github.com/nazstephen/Software-Development-Tools-Project) | This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit, designed for analyzing a car advertisement dataset. It provides users with a platform to explore various attributes of cars, including condition, model year, price, and mileage. Through features like histograms and scatter plots, users can gain insights into relationships between these attributes, such as understanding the distribution of car conditions across model years and the impact of mileage on car prices | _pandas, streamlit, and plotly_ |
| Integrated Project 1 | You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. | _pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scipy_ |
| SQL Project | You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. | _requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib and scipy_ |
