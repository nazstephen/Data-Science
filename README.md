# Projects
Compilation of all projects I've completed throughout [TripleTen's Data Science Bootcamp](https://tripleten.com/data-science/) 

| Name                   | Description            | Libraries                  |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------- |:---------------------------|
| [Python Project](https://github.com/nazstephen/Data-Science/tree/main/Python%20Project) | In this project, you will work with data from the entertainment industry. You will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the "Golden Age" of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing. The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives impacts its ratings. | _pandas_ |
| [EDA Project](https://github.com/nazstephen/Data-Science/tree/main/EDA%20Project) | Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place a grocery order and have it delivered to them, similar to how Uber Eats and Door Dash work. Your mission is to clean up the data and prepare a report that gives insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. | _pandas and matplotlib_ |
| [SDA Project](https://github.com/nazstephen/Data-Science/tree/main/SDA%20Project) | You work as an analyst for the telecom operator Megaline. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department wants to know which of the plans brings in more revenue in order to adjust the advertising budget. You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. | _pandas, numpy, scipy and matplotlib_ |
| [Software Development Tools Project](https://github.com/nazstephen/Software-Development-Tools-Project) | This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit, designed for analyzing a car advertisement dataset. It provides users with a platform to explore various attributes of cars, including condition, model year, price, and mileage. Through features like histograms and scatter plots, users can gain insights into relationships between these attributes, such as understanding the distribution of car conditions across model years and the impact of mileage on car prices | _pandas, streamlit, and plotly_ |
| [Integrated Project 1](https://github.com/nazstephen/Data-Science/tree/main/Integrated%20Project%201) | You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. | _pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scipy_ |
| [SQL Project](https://github.com/nazstephen/Data-Science/tree/main/SQL%20Project) | You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. | _requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, matplotlib and scipy_ | 
| [Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/nazstephen/Data-Science/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20Project) | Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. Develop a model with the highest possible accuracy. | _pandas and sklearn_ |
| [Supervised Learning Project]() | Beta Bank customers are leaving: little by little, chipping away every month. The bankers figured out itâ€™s cheaper to save the existing customers rather than to attract new ones. Predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon by building a machine learning model with the maximum possible F1 score. |  |
